# 3 Column Preview Card Component

## 📄 Project Overview
This project is a solution to the Frontend Mentor 3 Column Preview Card Challenge, which focuses on building a simple, responsive 3-column card layout using HTML and CSS. I developed the layout using Flexbox for alignment and responsiveness, while applying the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for organizing my CSS.

## 💡 Biggest Challenges
The most significant challenge I faced was learning and applying the BEM methodology for the first time. Structuring the CSS with BEM was a new experience and required a learning curve, but it helped maintain better class naming conventions and made the CSS more manageable.
